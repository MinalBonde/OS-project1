Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics emphasizes real-world applications. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming itself involves the use of programming languages and complex systems. Humanâ€“computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers useful, usable, and accessible.
