Properties of Command Line Arguments: They are passed to main() function. They are parameters/arguments supplied to the program when it is invoked. They are used to control program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code. 
Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.[18][19] It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704[20] and later the IBM 709[21] computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices. "Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating [â€¦] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again".[18] During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.
